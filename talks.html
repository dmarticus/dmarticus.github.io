<h1>Talks</h1>
In an effort to both share the things I learn and to solidify my own knowledge, I've started to put together some talks
about programming, working, or whatever else.

<h3>Work-adjacent</h3>
<ul>
        <li><b>Deep Work</b>: This was my first solo talk at Qualtrics, which I gave in October of 2019. It was
                terrifying,
                took way too long to put
                together, and it was an absolute blast. <a href="./media/deep-work.pdf" rel="noreferrer"

and I've
put together several talks over the years at our various different sessions. I've never come close to winning "Best
Presentation but I won "Best-Dressed" once.
