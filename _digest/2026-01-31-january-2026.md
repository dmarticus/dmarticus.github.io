summary: "First digest of 2026 after a long time off!  This one covers two months of reading (December and January).  Lots of good essays this time around — Cate Hall on effort and self-deception, Sam Kriss on Iran, Phil Haack on his first year at PostHog.  On the tech side: agent coding is going mainstream, Steve Yegge is building multi-agent workspaces, and fireflies synchronize in ways that will blow your mind."
