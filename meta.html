<h1>Meta</h1>

<p>This site is generated with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, a static
  site generator written in Ruby. It's been great so far, although I just came across <a
    href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Hakyll</a>
  recently, and I'm tempted to port this site to Hakyll on some theoretical lazy afternoon in the future.
</p>
<p>It's hosted on <a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/dmarticus.github.io" rel="noreferrer"
    target="_blank">Github</a>.
  It has no external dependencies and only uses javascript for traffic analytics (i.e. no javascript is required to run
  anything on the page). I was heavily inspired by
  <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this charming site</a> when I made this one --
  I
  think a lot of
  websites are over-engineered, and I wanted my site to be as simple and lightweight as possible.
  As a result, my website may not have any fancy features, but it renders well on every device, it's fast, and it's
  accessible to users with screen readers and other
  alternative browsers.
  What more could a personal website need?
