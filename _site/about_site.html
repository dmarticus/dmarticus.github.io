      <h1>About The Site</h1>
<p>This site is generated with Jekyll.  I used to use Hugo but it generated way too much extra styling/html cruft and I wanted to have the ability to pop into each file and edit each post myself (and I'm bad at HTML so I wanted something easy).  Plus I'm learning Ruby so Jekyll seemed like a cool tool in Ruby to use.
</p>
<p>
It's hosted on <a href=https://github.com/dmarticus/dmarticus.github.io>Github</a>.
It has no external dependencies and currently 0 javascript!  I was heavily inspired by <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this charming site</a>; I definitely think a lot of websites are super over-engineered for their purposes. 
But yeah, my website renders well on every device, it's fast, and it's accessible to users with screen readers and other alternative ways of browsing the content.  Until we can be better interent stewards the internet needs less JS.
</p>

<p>
It's being actively worked on. I'd like to turn it into a blog with an RSS feed, host some HTML5 games, or link out to interesting distributed systems stuff.  It's just my little corner of the internet.
