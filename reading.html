<h1>Reading</h1>

I consume a lot of content (what can I say, I'm a millennial in 2020) and I like sharing cool stuff I find.
So, I figured I'd try and make a running list of links to things I've consumed and why I like them.
Call it link curation, call it time-wasting; whatever -- it brings me joy. If you want to be updated on the latest
batch, I send these links out
every week in <a href="/subscribe.html">my newsletter</a>.

<div class="reading">
        {% for readable in site.curation %}
        <p>{{ readable.content }}</p>
        {% endfor %}
</div>
