<h1>Reading</h1>

I consume a lot of content (what can I say, I'm a millennial in 2020) and I like sharing cool stuff I find.
So, I figured I'd try and make a running list of links to things I've consumed and why I like them. 
Call it link curation, call it time-wasting; whatever -- it brings me joy.
Perhaps one day I'll make this into a newsletter.

<h2>Links (updated weekly)</h2>
