<h1>Reading</h1>

I consume a lot of content (what can I say, I'm a millennial in 2020) and I like sharing cool stuff I find.
So, I figured I'd try and make a running list of links to things I've consumed and why I like them.
Call it link curation, call it time-wasting; whatever -- it brings me joy.
Perhaps one day I'll make this into a newsletter.

<h2>Links (updated weekly)</h2>

                        Awe.</a>
                This piece discusses capitalism's impact in devaluing essential services through the les of American
                libraries. I recommend it if you're curious about how libraries work in the US and you want to get mad
                about how little they tend to be valued financially.</li>

                read all week imo. This piece attempts to explain what the hell the stock market has been up to during
                these last few months that's accessible for an everyman. I recommend it to anyone who's curious about
                why everyone is talking about stonks.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Incomplete List of Mistakes
                        in the Design of CSS.</a>
                I'm into language design and it's cool to see the CSS working group being so transparent in sharing the
                mistakes that were made when developing the language. CSS is also a very different language than many
                other programming languages so the fact that many of the mistakes appear syntactic belies the fact that
                they are often related to the architecture. This list is also interesting to consider if you wanted to
                work on developing a DSL that transpiles to CSS, for example.</li>

                        target="_blank">Living in Someone Elses Portland.</a>
                I'm obsessed with AHP's <i>Culture Study</i>, so forgive me if I post about it a lot. But this piece
                resonated with me because it interviewed actual people in Portland to get their perspective on what's
                happening there, which (of course), is much mellower than entertainment media wants us to believe. As a
                Seattleite who dealt with this same overblown crap when CHOP was happening, this piece feels
                vindicating.</li>

                        rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">America Is Trapped in a Pandemic Spiral.</a>
                Another awesome COVID-19 piece from Ed Yong, this one focuses on the idea of why it's so hard to feel
                like you have any stability in US (largely due to systemic gaslight by the institutions meant to protect
                the US citizens). Good read if you're feeling helpless and you want to assign a mental model towards the
                helplessness.</li>
        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03393.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Generative Language Modeling
                        for Automated
                        Theorem Proving.</a>
                This is a potentially seminal paper from OpenAI that lays the foundation of AI-driven automated theorem
                proving, which goes a long way towards training AI towards writing software. The ramifications are
                exciting and terrifying.</li>

<ul>
        <li><a href="https://typing-is-hard.ch/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Typing is Hard.</a> This post outlines
                type checking and decidability in an accessible way. I recommend it to someone who's familiar with the
                concepts of type systems and can understand the difference between statically and dynamically typed
                languages but wants to learn more about the subtle differences across popular statically typed langages.
                If you're into compilers you'll probably like it :)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.jvt.me/pƒosts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/" rel="noreferrer"
                        target="_blank">Against Online
                        Tooling.</a> The TL;DR is that online tools for things like JWT generation, diff checking, or
                anything else are access points for accidentally leaking sensitive data. The author encourages doing
                these operations locally as much as possible.</li>
        <li><a href="http://calpaterson.com/bicycle-threat-model.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Bicycle
                        Threat Model.</a>
                An introduction to threat modeling via a practical example: keeping your bicycle safe in a city. I
                recommend for anyone who wants a practical example for threat modeling (perhaps to explain to a
                non-tech-y family member or friend).</li>

                        target="_blank">The Case of the top secret iPod.</a>
                Cool read on an internal project at Apple that sheds some insights into what work at one of the most
                secretive
                companies in the US is like.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.microcovid.org/calculator" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Microcovid Calculator.</a>
                Play around with your COVID-19 risk level! If you're someone who likes extrapolating risk from
                incomplete data sets, you'll probably have fun with it. This is a reminder that I am Not A Doctor.</li>
        <li><a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/lofi-player" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Lofi-Player.</a>
                Creative project from Google Brain's magenta project that creates lo-fi beeps n boops using RNNs and
                provides a cute pixelated UI to boot. Not quite robust enough to have running in the background during
                work to try and flow to, but definitely good for spending a break to play around with it.</li>
        <li><a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">How NAT
                        Traversal.</a>
                Tailscale is a cool company that is tackling the challenge of building a secure network
                without needing to rely on sysadmins for each intersection, and their blog is generally great. I
                recommend this piece if you're curious about the technical specifics of how networked devices actually
                connect with each other.</li>
        <li><a href="https://softwarebyscience.com/very-short-functions-are-a-code-smell-an-overview-of-the-science-on-function-length/"
                        rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">An Overview on the Science of Function Length.</a>
                More empirical analysis of software quality, this time trying to answer the hypothesis of whether very
                short functions are actually a code smell (one of my many pieces that challenges the "clean code" style
                of programming). I recommend it if you like reading attempted objective analysis of a relatively
                ambiguous subject.</li>
        <li><a href="https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Shell Commands
                        Rewritten in Rust.</a>
                List of shell utilities (traditionally written in C) that have been re-written and improved in Rust.
                You'll probably like this if you're into system utilities or are a big Rust fan.</li>

                        Microservices using Modern Haskell.</a>
                This was written by my coworkers and is an example of a formal paper about industry-specific CS (in
                contrast with formal papers about more theoretical or abstract concepts). I recommend it if you're
                curious about microservice design using purely functional architectures, and I'm also biased because I
                work on the Scala version of this library so I think the work is personally cool.</li>
        <li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2897667.2897674" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Towards rigorous
                        design of domain-specific distributed systems.</a>
                So much of modern cloud computing is in distributed systems, and one of the killer apps of
                domain-specific
                modeling that many static FP languages do well is the ability to create programmatic DSLs (i.e. NOT
                yaml) to
                define complex distributed systems. This paper lays out a potential DSL design using that idea.</li>

                torrent of viral commentary that reliably drowns out both the mainstream media and the liberal
