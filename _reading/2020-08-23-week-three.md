#### Business

* [Open-sourcing Have I Been Pwned.](https://www.troyhunt.com/im-open-sourcing-the-have-i-been-pwned-code-base/) I loved all of the specifics that Troy Hunt goes into about running a massively successful open-source project.
* [Attack of the Clones: TikTokâ€™s Rival Kuaishou Lands in the US.](https://turner.substack.com/p/attack-of-the-clones-tiktoks-rival) Ponderous and thorough deep dive of Kuaishou.
* [Open-Source Knowledge.](https://www.swyx.io/speaking/open-source-knowledge/) Like the above link about learning in public, the author encourages using blogging, speaking, presenting to open-source your knowledge as well as your tech.
* [Gateway Pages prevent PDF Shock.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/gateway-pages-prevent-pdf-shock/) PDFs on the internet are still a rough experience and the author encourages alternatives to them.

#### Culture

* [What's the best thing?](https://best.tomscott.com/) Fun Tom Scott Project that compares things and shows you how you did against others.

#### Tech

* [Steve Yegge's Google Platform rant from 2011.](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611) TL;DR Google treats its employees better than its customers and that's why Amazon ate Google's lunch in the cloud platform space.
* [Steve Yegge's Google Deprecation rant from 2020.](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc) TL;DR it's more of the same from the above post, just 9 years later.
* [Gabriel Gonzalez's talk on marketing Haskell to mainstream programmers.](https://youtu.be/fNpsgTIpODA) A bunch of good takeaways from marketing not just Haskell, but any non-mainstream technology.
* [Low-Water Mark (part of a series on design patterns for distributed systems).](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/low-watermark.html) This post focuses on how to telling logging machinery which portion of the log can be safely discarded to avoid runaway disk storage.

#### Work

* [Learn in Public.](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) Incredibly inspirational post on blogging, writing, speaking, and embracing the public growth that comes therein.
