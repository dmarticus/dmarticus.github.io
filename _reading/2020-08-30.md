#### 8/24 - 8/30

  * [Capitalists Or Cronyists.](https://www.profgalloway.com/capitalists-or-cronyists) If you're looking for some well-reasoned words on why you think the US is bungling things on a massive scale but are pro-capitalism and you can't understand why it's not working in the US, you might find this piece insightful.
  * [United States Corona Corps.](https://www.profgalloway.com/united-states-corona-corps)
  * [GPT-3, Bloviator: OpenAI’s language generator has no idea what it’s talking about.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/) If you're super over GPT-3 FUD and want to read an empirical study about GPT-3 that isn't just full of bombastic takes, this is a good read. Despite the title, it's not really a hit piece on GPT-3 -- but it does lay out some specific edge cases where GPT-3 fails.
  * [between fked and a hard place.](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/between-fked-and-a-hard-place) This article interviews a bunch of higher education workers across the country to paint a worrying picture of higher education's response to COVID-19 in the US. Solid doomscrolling content.
  * [Is WFH affecting the S&P;?](https://themargins.substack.com/p/is-wfh-affecting-the-s-and-p) I recommend this article if you're curious about the affect that WFH has on the stock market
  * [Formal methods intro.](https://migue.github.io/post/formal-methods-intro/) I recommend this for anybody who wants to learn more about Formal Verification but is intimidated by some of the methodologies and jargon (i.e. me).
  * [But does it help you ship?.](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/08/25/but-does-it-help-you-ship/) Fun read on the actual cost of adding automations.
  * [Parser Combinators.](https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/) Technical deep dive on writing a parse combinator in Rust from scratch. I recommend it to anyone who's into parsers, programming language, Rust, or any combination of the three.
  * [Reachability Modulo Theories](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rmt.pdf) and [A Solver for Reachability Modulo Theories.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-45.pdf)
  * [The Friendship that made Google Huge](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge). The story of Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google. The least gloomy thing I've read in the last 5 months.
  * [Why Efficiency is Dangerous and Slowing Down Makes Life Better](https://psyche.co/ideas/why-efficiency-is-dangerous-and-slowing-down-makes-life-better). Click bait title aside, this post makes a compelling case for being cautious about aiming for efficiency at all costs.
  * [Don't Ask to Ask, Just Ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/) This piece speaks to my soul: it's a quick read on a best practice for async communication. Reminds me of [nohello.com](https://www.nohello.com/).
  * [Questions.](https://patrickcollison.com/questions) Patrick Collison writes some great posts on the big questions he's chewing on. Inspirational stuff.
  * [Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax.](https://www.vidarholen.net/~vidar/An_Empirical_Investigation_into_Programming_Language_Syntax.pdf) A cool read that attempts to answer the question of "which parts programming language syntax is good and which ones are bad?"
  * [Insane Story about the Kidnapping of Sultan bin Turki II.](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/08/how-saudi-prince-sultan-disappeared)

  * [Shadows.](https://www.profgalloway.com/shadows) Chilling piece on the state of political discourse in the US.
  * [Hack Your Career by Troy Hunt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MUhcgXBj_A&t=0s) As an aspiring independent consultant this is a great watch
  * [Just quit your job at Facebook already.](https://themargins.substack.com/p/facebook-the-pr-firm)
