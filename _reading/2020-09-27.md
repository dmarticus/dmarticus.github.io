#### 9/21 - 9/27

Got a bunch of cool things on Github this week, various posts about parsers, and some fun meditations on removing oneself from the machine.  Enjoy :)

* [Side Project Marketing Checklist](https://github.com/portable-cto/side-project-marketing/blob/master/marketing-checklist.md) One of my big hobbies during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to learn more about (and spend more time working on) side projects, and I found this guide helpful.  It's a bit too thorough for the types of projects I'm currently doing, but it's comprehensive, and I recommend it for anyone who's interested in marketing their side projects and doesn't know where to start.
* [Holbert: A Graphical Interactive Proof Assistant Designed for Education](https://github.com/liamoc/holbert) Liam O'Connor is a programming languages researcher in London and they just released a really cool-looking theorem prover that, unlike many automated theorem provers, comes with a graphical component for the visually oriented.  I recommend anyone who's interested in theorem proving or formal verification to check it out.
* [My favorite Rust function](https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/favorite-rust-function) I'm working on a lot on parsers at work, so I've got tokenizing on the brain, and this post was a great deep dive into a great Rust function for tokenizing (a function that I learned about in Bodil Stokke's [post](https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/) about writing a parser in Rust!).  If you're interested in Rust, parsers, or even just clever programming in general, you should check this post out (and Bodil's too!)
* [The 3 Tribes of Programming](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/) When researching the author of the previous post I noticed they referenced this article when it came to classifying different types of programmers.  Personally, I don't think anyone fits into a neat box when it comes to programming styles, but this article is a fun read if you enjoy pieces that make you look internally and classify yourself.
* [Make Now Just Lab on Github](https://github.com/MakeNowJust-Labo) In reading about parsers in Scala I stumbled onto this guy's Github portfolio, which blew my mind.  You owe it on yourself to check out this body of open-source work.
* [Quine Codes](https://quine.codes/).  This is the personal website of the aforementioned Github page!  Of course it's one of the coolest personal website I've stumbled upon.
* [Ousterhout's dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy) I hadn't heard of this concept before but it's an interesting classification of languages.  Personally, I think it's a pretty arbitrary distinction, but at least it got my thinking about how to categorize different types of programming languages.  
* [In the computer](https://chris-martin.org/2020/in-the-computer) This is my new favorite meta-article on reasoning about program logic.  Whether you're a declarative, imperative, or functional programmer (or any composition of the 3); I imagine you'll get value out of this piece.
* [Brunello Cucinelli â€“ On my Om](https://om.co/2015/04/27/brunello-cucinelli-2/) I love fashion and I've always been into Brunello Cucinelli, but I never knew how philosophical or interesting the man was.  I kinda stumbled upon this link by accident but I couldn't stop thinking about it all day that I read it.
* [TikTok and the new American capitalism - Margins by Ranjan Roy and Can Duruk](https://themargins.substack.com/p/tiktok-and-the-new-american-capitalism) My weekly Margins piece ;)
