### 11/09 - 11/15


#### Business

#### Culture

#### Life

#### Work

* [How I Start](https://howistart.org/). Often tutorials and books are overly generic, leaving it up to the reader to wade through all the tools and styles available to a language on their own. These articles are meant for a user who is comfortable with a language in its REPL (if available) or building individual modules, but may not be comfortable taking the step to producing an application or library that is ready to be consumed by others or deployed to production.

#### Tech

* [Haskell: The Bad Parts, part 2](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/11/haskell-bad-parts-2).  Another excellent criticism of some of Haskell's warts from the prolific Snoyberg.  If you're interested in critiquing programming language design choices, especially for a language as carefully designed as Haskell, you'll likely enjoy this read.  Rust fans probably will, too ;)
* [Distributed Systems Learning Diary](https://timilearning.com/).  A great example of learning in public by a guy named Timil in London.  I'm currently working through his notes (and the source material) from the [Spark Course](https://timilearning.com/posts/mit-6.824/lecture-15-spark/).  
* [Average UX Improvements Are Shrinking Over Time](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-gains-shrinking/) this is good actually; we're stabilizing.  TODO
* [Foundations of Software Engineering](https://cmu-313.github.io/).  Lecture Notes from CMU's Software Engineering class. 
* [How to Make the Kotlin Compiler Smarter](https://deniskrr.medium.com/how-to-make-the-compiler-smarter-b37f414875ac).  Kotlin compiler optimization.  TODO
* [Why Typing Erlang is Hard](https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/am012-why-typing-erlang-is-hard.html).  Type systems. TODO
