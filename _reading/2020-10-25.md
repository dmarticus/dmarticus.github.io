Alexandru Nedelcu is an excellent Scala engineer and prolific writer, and these two pieces are great foundations (with plenty of example code) for understanding how to build pure IOApps and effect runtimes using Cats and Cats-Effect.  If you're interested in pure FP for Scala, understanding this is the equivalent to a 101 course, and Alex makes it really easy to grok.
