### 10/05 - 10/11

* [Why is Snowflake so Valuable?](https://www.freshpaint.io/blog/why-is-snowflake-so-valuable).  This piece makes the case that the high valuation of Snowflake is largely due to strong performance in the following 5 metrics: (1) Growth (2) Net Retention (3) Net Promoter Score (NPS) (4) Average Contract Value and (5) Net Loss.  At my old company we frequently measured our success against these 5 metrics as well, as we ended up with a similar result to Snowflake where we were acquired at a valuation that about 10x'd our revenue.  Our numbers weren't as insane as Snowflake, but these metrics seem  like a pretty good gold standard for a SaaS company valuation.
* [Things I Was Wrong About: Types — Sympolymathesy, by Chris Krycho](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/things-i-was-wrong-about/1-types/).  I'm really into strongly-typed languages, so this piece was a fun read for me to challenge my assumption that strong typing is _always_ a good thing for a programming languages.  The major takeways from the author are that the 3 major benefits of type systems in a language are (1) type inference, (2) type soundness, and (3) sum/tagged union types.  
* [For a Good Time, Call](https://www.guernicamag.com/for-a-good-time-call/).  A story of two young women and growing up in Las Vegas in the early 2000s, told through stories on the party line.  I'd never heard of party lines until [this podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/nz/podcast/p-line/id1522337888?i=1000485162923) from California Love, and now this is the second story in less than a month I've read about them.  I missed this train as a kid, lol.
* [How normal am I?](https://www.hownormalami.eu/).  This website is an experiment from Dutch privacy researcher Tijmen Schep that tries to codify how normal your online profile is based on ~20 key demographics.  It's pretty shocking to see how much data is colected about you in the process of browsing the internet, and this piece is a sobering reminder about all the privacy many internet users willingly give up to be online.  If this subject matter interests you, Schep has another site that I recommend checking out: [Social Cooling](https://www.socialcooling.com/).
* [The Era of Visual Studio Code](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/).  I write a ton of content on VSCode (including this blog!), and it's pretty amazing to see the dominance of this editor among developers in the last decade.  VSCode is a great example of how powerful an editor can become when a powerful company focuses on the right things and aggressively innovates on them.  
* [I was wrong. CRDTs are the future](https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-are-the-future/).  I'm still trying to understand this piece (and the [original talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7drE24geUw) about [Conflict-free replicated data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) from Martin Kleppmann), but it's exciting to see all of the breakthrough happening in distributed computing, since I'm a big believe that the future of software will continue to be distributed.
