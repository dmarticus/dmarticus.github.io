  * [The Rise of TikTok and Understanding Its Parent Company ByteDance.](https://turner.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-tiktok-and-understanding) Deep dive on TikTok. One of the most interesting reads on TikTok that I've ever encountered. Scares the shit out of me.
  * [Pinduoduo and Vertically Integrated Social Commerce.](https://turner.substack.com/p/pinduoduo-and-vertically-integrated) How to build a tech giant. Also scares the shit out of me. 
  * [Can you know too much about your organization?.](https://hbr.org/2019/12/can-you-know-too-much-about-your-organization) This piece helps shed some light on why you feel disenchanted about working at the same place for a while despite enjoying your day job.

  * [Oatly: The New Coke.](https://divinations.substack.com/p/oatly-the-new-coke#) Oatly probably doesn't care agbout your health.
  * [Drive and Listen.](https://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/) Traveling in the time of travel bans.

  * [Twitter, George Soros, and Porn](https://themargins.substack.com/p/twitter-george-soros-and-porn) (this is my 3rd _Margins_ post in as many weeks; if you like pop finance you should just sub to them already)
  * [GaryVee Is Still Preaching the Hustle Gospel in the Middle of a Pandemic.](https://marker.medium.com/garyvee-is-still-preaching-the-hustle-gospel-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic-b033b25f0dc) Just trust me.
  * [Software disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) (an oldie but goodie). There's so much software out there that just hasn't been made well and there's many reasons why (and this post explains a bunch of them) but it's still sad.
