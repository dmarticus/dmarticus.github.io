The list is shorter this week -- I was on vacation and kinda stayed away from tech and the internet in general as possible (I did, however, go on a lot of hikes, I read 2 books, and ate a bunch of good food!)  There were still a few pieces that I read from the tech world, though, so I figured I'd share them :)  They're mostly about Scala and Haskell, with a few fun pieces (including Aphyr's latest technical interview satire).  Enjoy!

#### Tech

* [5 tips for writing great client SDK libraries](https://medium.com/wix-engineering/5-tips-for-writing-great-client-libraries-f6d02d57fdcc).  Wix has a great engineering blog, especially for Scala-related work, and I recommend this guide to anyone looking to write an open-source library in Scala and doesn't know where to start.  (I'm also writing a blog post about getting started in open-source, so stay tuned!)
* [Mu-Haskell 0.4 Released](https://www.47deg.com/blog/mu-haskell-0-4/).  This is a bit of a biased article but I work on the mu ecosystem at 47 Degrees and my Haskell coworkers just released an excellent addition to the library.  This piece is a good complement to the Sam Halliday article because it talks a lot about the practical benefits of using mu with Haskell to build a modern distributed microservice without adding too much complexity.  

#### Work

* [Rewriting the Technical Interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/353-rewriting-the-technical-interview).  Aphyr has written several hilarious posts about tech interviewing that are as technical and brilliant as they are entertaining.  Each one is a treat to read.  Here's their newest :)
* [The Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7).  I recommend this to anyone who's looking to level up their communications game (which should be almost everyone -- good communication skills are absolutely worth their weight in gold in tech).  The Pyramid Principle is a tried-and-true McKinsey practice for effective communicating complex topics.  
* [Daniel Ek](https://www.theobservereffect.org/daniel.html).  The Observer Effect is a new site I've found that does longform interviews with tech leaders.  I enjoyed this profile on Spotify's Daniel Ek, I love how much Daniel empowers his team around him to make good decisions and how that empowerment frees up time for him to focus on the future (he mentions that he's currently focused on 2025, which is crazy to think about).
* [Delivering with Haskell](https://medium.com/@fommil/delivering-with-haskell-a347d8359597).  Sam Halliday (@fommil) is an excellent writer and very knowledgeable about FP, especially Haskell.  I recommend this piece for anyone who's looking for some guiding principles about being an effective industrial engineering team with Haskell (or for anyone who _wants_ to be an industrial engineering team with Haskell).
