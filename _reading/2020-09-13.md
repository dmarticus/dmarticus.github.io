#### 9/7 - 9/13

  * [Vocational Awe.](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/vocational-awe) This piece discusses capitalism's impact in devaluing essential services through the les of American libraries. I recommend it if you're curious about how libraries work in the US and you want to get mad about how little they tend to be valued financially.
  * [SoftBank, Robinhood, and a Margins Singularity](https://themargins.substack.com/p/softbank-robinhood-and-a-margins). The best pop-finance you'll read all week imo. This piece attempts to explain what the hell the stock market has been up to during these last few months that's accessible for an everyman. I recommend it to anyone who's curious about why everyone is talking about stonks.
  * [Incomplete List of Mistakes in the Design of CSS.](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes) I'm into language design and it's cool to see the CSS working group being so transparent in sharing the mistakes that were made when developing the language. CSS is also a very different language than many other programming languages so the fact that many of the mistakes appear syntactic belies the fact that they are often related to the architecture. This list is also interesting to consider if you wanted to work on developing a DSL that transpiles to CSS, for example.
  * [Living in Someone Else's Portland.](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/living-in-someone-elses-portland) I'm obsessed with AHP's _Culture Study_ , so forgive me if I post about it a lot. But this piece resonated with me because it interviewed actual people in Portland to get their perspective on what's happening there, which (of course), is much mellower than entertainment media wants us to believe. As a Seattleite who dealt with this same overblown crap when CHOP was happening, this piece feels vindicating.
  * [America Is Trapped in a Pandemic Spiral.](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/pandemic-intuition-nightmare-spiral-winter/616204/) Another awesome COVID-19 piece from Ed Yong, this one focuses on the idea of why it's so hard to feel like you have any stability in US (largely due to systemic gaslight by the institutions meant to protect the US citizens). Good read if you're feeling helpless and you want to assign a mental model towards the helplessness.
  * [Generative Language Modeling for Automated Theorem Proving.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03393.pdf) This is a potentially seminal paper from OpenAI that lays the foundation of AI-driven automated theorem proving, which goes a long way towards training AI towards writing software. The ramifications are exciting and terrifying.
  * [Timeline of low-temperature technology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_low-temperature_technology) In a world that seems to be heating up constantly, it's interesting to reflect on all the various times where humans moved to a place, set up shop to keep things cold, and innovated.
  * [How can you not be romantic about programming?](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/08/how-can-you-not-be-romantic-about-programming/) I love Thorsten's writings and this blog is a great koan about how cool programming is. Say what you want about tech as an economic or social system, a lot of us got into the industry because of the pure joy of programming, and this read helped rekindle some of that love.
  * [Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model.](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html) I read this a year ago but it came up again in my work Slack today and generated a lot of buzz. I like ErikBern's writing in general and this is one of the few pieces with a "Why X is Y" title that, instead of being a puff piece, tackles an ambiguous problem (project planning) with statistics. I recommend it for any engineer, but especially an engineering manager who's looking to improve their metrics around project planning. 
  * [Lucid Dreaming with Neural Nets.](https://mikelynch.org/2015/Aug/29/lucid-dreaming-with-neural-nets/) My buddy [Jack](https://twitter.com/JFK_but_lamer) sent me this one and it's a great little post that showcases what remains my favorite application of Neural Nets: making trippy art in a programmic way. I'm hopeless at fine motor skills but I love that programs like this help people like me make art with nothing but computers and a little creativity.
  * [How to speed up the rust compiler.](https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/09/08/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-one-last-time/) The last in a series of 10 posts dating back to 2016 from the principal engineer on the rust compiler. The whole list is worth reading if you're the type of person who's curious about compiler technical details and micro-optimizations.
  * [Android build and the journey to the end game.](https://proandroiddev.com/android-build-and-the-journey-to-the-end-game-55c9766325c5) This post is also on micro-optimizations, only this time on a higher-level: it outlines how to speed up an android gradle build. I recommend it to anyone who's familiar with Android and gradle and is looking to improve the speed of their builds through a few accessible micro-optimizations.
  * [When you browse Instagram and find former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's passport number.](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram) This is the most fun vulnerability disclosure I've ever read. "Alex" is hilarious and their posts are both insightful and a great read.
  * [A Robot Wrote this Article.](https://cacm.acm.org/news/247248-a-robot-wrote-this-entire-article-are-you-scared-yet-human/fulltext) I'm not worried about AGI coming for my job as an engineer just yet, but it's still cool seeing software write an op-ed without any human input.
  * [Nothing to see here, folks.](https://heated.world/p/nothing-to-see-here-folks) The West Coast of the US is extremely on fire currently and it's incredibly hard to ignore; as of writing this my city has some of the worst air quality of all the major west coast cities. This piece makes the case that major media outlets in the US are refusing to acknowledge systemic climate change as a cause for these fires. This type of negligence makes many folks (including yours truly) pretty outraged.
  * [It was never enough.](https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/it-was-never-enough/) Fun long read from the Texas Monthly that profiles a prolific businessman / erstwhile scam artist who committed the wildest insurance fraud in the history of Texas.
  * [An intuition for optics.](https://about.chatroulette.com/posts/optics/) Tony Morris has written a bunch of intuitions on useful FP Algebraic Data Types over the last few weeks and I finally am getting around to reading them. I wish I'd read them earlier, honestly. If you're keen on trying to understand some genuinely useful FP concepts and their associated algebraic jargon, start here.
  * [A Deep Dive Into the 'Gentrification Font'.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ep499w/gentrification-font-meme-neutraface) If, like me, you live in a neighborhood where it seems like bougie construction is cropping up everywhere, you may sometimes feel that all new development looks the same. This story sheds some light on how some aspects of new development (such as the typefaces used) are exactly as isomorphic as you may think.
  * [Thoughts on Haskell in 2020.](https://alpacaaa.net/thoughts-on-haskell-2020/) This week I read a lot about the "pragmatic" Haskell, which the concept of writing Haskell code that (while maybe not as powerful or fancily-typed as possible) is readable, maintainable, and takes advantages of Haskell's static typing and ergonomics. There's this whole movement called Boring Haskell that's been espousing this concept for years, (see writings from [Fommil](https://medium.com/@fommil/simple-haskell-is-best-haskell-6a1ea59c73b), [Snoyman](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2019/11/boring-haskell-manifesto), and [Matt Parsons](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2019/12/26/write_junior_code.html)), but it's still a hard habit to break, especially for people who are drawn to Haskell because of all the type-level abstractions you get to do with it. In my opinion, this post is best-targeted at (a) someone who wants to use Haskell at work and needs some data to help their manager or director sign off on a project or (b) someone who works on an existing Haskell team that's struggling to hire developers with the necessary pre-requisite programming skills to write complex Haskell code.
  * [Dependent and refinement types: why?](https://www.47deg.com/blog/why-types/) LMAO so I know I just got off my soapbox talking about why simple Haskell is best, but that doesn't mean it's not worth understanding some of the strong types in Haskell so that you can take advantage of them when you code. In this post by my coworker Alejandro, he walks through the benefits of understanding rudimentary types in Haskell and how you can ultimately use dependent types to prove things to the compiler, which leads to writing code that is free of (software) bugs by definition
  * [Safe, Expressive Code with Refinement Types](https://tech.ovoenergy.com/safe-expressive-code-with-refinement-types/) On the heels of Alejandro's post about the theoretical benefits of refinement types is this post from Gordon Rennie at OVO Energy that goes through an example of how to use refinement types to safely and elegantly handle input validation, which is a problem that is the scourge of many a web developer but, as Rennie argues in this post, is trivial to handle if you use a language that supports refinement types like Scala.
