This week I did a lot more production than consumption; work was pretty hectic and I also wanted to finish part two of my fantasy football data science blog post (here's part one, if you want the full story).  As a result, I've got fewer pieces that I read and thought about this week, and I definitely skewed more towards interesting cultural tidbits than deeply technical pieces.  Enjoy!
