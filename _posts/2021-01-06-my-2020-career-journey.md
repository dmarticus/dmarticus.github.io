2020 felt like a particularly long year for a variety of reasons, and one of the reasons it felt long for me was because, after 5 years at the same company, I switched jobs twice this year -- I started the year at Qualtrics, then did a stint at 47 Degrees before joining Mercury at the start of December.  Since I went through so many interesting career transitions after such a long time at my first job, I wanted to write down some of my reflections throughout the process.

## A brief summary of my career in 2020

### Part I (January - June): Qualtrics

At the beginning of the year, I was working as a software engineer at Qualtrics on our digital experience platform: my team was responsible for the highest-throughput service at the company since our product was similar to an ad-targeting service (our platform supported popup surveys that could be embedded on customer websites).  We were working on a lot of interesting engineering problems due to our high scale, and we were writing a lot of Scala with Akka to take advantage of its great support for high performance, highly scalable, highly maintainable, and highly available applications.  This was my first exposure to writing Scala and learning about functional programming, and I was _hooked_.  In fact, I enjoyed FP so much that I convinced Qualtrics to sponsor my attendance to LambdaConf, where I met a bunch of other interesting folks who were just as obsessed with FP as I.  

TODO MENTION LAMBDACONF BEING BIG FOR 47
In fact, LambdaConf was a critical place for me in my career, because while there I met a bunch of interesting folks who worked at a variety of cool FP companies.

I did some interesting work at Qualtrics this year.  I shipped the new stats pipeline and designed the smart DX targeting.  Also led ops for disaster recovery and mentored other people.  However, despite enjoying the interesting scale challenges on my team at Qualtrics, all I could think about was doing more FP, and even though my team was using Scala, we weren't really doing functional programming; we were more using Scala as a "better Java".  So, when 47 Degrees reached out to talk about potentially hiring me as a senior software engineer, I jumped at the chance to interview with them.  I got the job in May, and I to take a month to ramp off my work at Qualtrics so that I could have my last day there be the 5 year anniversary of my first day :')  It was a bittersweet ending, but a new adventure at 47 Degrees beckoned.

* how to not run disaster recovery

### Part II (June - December): 47 Degrees

After my bittersweet farewell to Qualtrics on my 5-year anniversary of the company, I took a few weeks off to recharge and hike around the SEattle area.  After tha, I was super excited to join 47 Degrees! I couldn't believe that I was about to get paid to work on cool open-source libraries; that I'd get to write pure FP in Scala using libraries such as Cats, Cats-Effect and Monix; and that I'd get to work with some of the best functional programmers engineers in the world, including the authors of Arrow, Scala-Exercises, Bow, and mu-haskell.  It seemed like a dream come true.  And in many ways it was!  I learned a ton about being a good open-source steward (see my blog post on that subject), and I leveled up my knowledge of functional programming in Scala and Kotlin.  In my time there, I maintained and improved OSS libraries, blogged, became much more comfortable with FP concepts that I blogged about them (wrote blog post about them).  I was really enjoying all of the things I was learning and the people I was working with, and I had no plans to leave anytime soon.  However life, as it tends to do, managed to intervene.  

See, one of the things about 47 Degrees that I was apprehensive about was that it was a consulting firm, rather than being a product-focused tech company.  I had no experience working as a consultant, but I was curious about how it was a job, and I figured that 47 would provide some experience into that role.  Some aspects of it were good, but other aspects weren't as much of a fit, and it was during one of those periods of me feeling like a bad fit as a consultant that I heard from recruiter at Mercury.  And Mercury seemed too good to be true: they were working in a space that I found interesting (re-inventing business banking) using a tech stack that was super appealing to my interests and expertise (Haskell on the backend and React + TypeScript on the frontend).  I wasn't sure what my future was going to look like at 47, but I figured I couldn't turn down a shot to interview with Mercury, and after it was all said and done, I ended up taking an offer there at the beginning of December.

* wanted to push my FP knowledge further, learn more about the open-source ecosystem and getting involved in that space, and to try my hand at consulting
* Big L: didn't set concrete goals for what I wanted out of my time there. AS a result, when consulting appeared to not be a fit, it was very compelling for me to jump ship.
* Big W: as a result of falling deeper into the FP rabbit hole, joined a new FP community online and learned about this cool Haskell shop, Mercury.
* Scala, Kotlin
* how to struggle as a consultant
* how to be a good OSS steward and to get involved in OSS (blog post)

### Part III (December - ???): Mercury

So now I'm at Mercury.  I'm only a few weeks in, especially since I joined right before the holiday break, but so far this place seems like a perfect mix of working on a product (something I realized I really missed while at 47), but using a purely functional stack with a team of similarly-motivated people (something I never had at Qualtrics).  I'm pretty jazzed to have a found a job that's such a perfect blend of my current career interests and goals, and I can't wait to see what this year brings.  I haven't had a chance to make much of an impact yet, but there's two things that I've already done at Mercury that I'm pretty stoked about.  One was finishing HPFFP, the other was writing a recording a song for the [Mercury Christmas Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvrv1My-pFY&feature=youtu.be) (my song is at 13:27).  I'd say so far, so good :)
