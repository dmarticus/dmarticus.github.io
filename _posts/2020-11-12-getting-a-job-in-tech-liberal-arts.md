post_summary: "As a software engineer at 47 Degrees, I'm ostensibly a member of the open-source community, since 47 Degrees spends a lot of time and resources on maintaining a few hundred libraries in Scala, Haskell, Kotlin, and Swift.  However, unlike other folks at the company who were involved in open-source before they joined, I was never involved in a significant open-source project before joining."
