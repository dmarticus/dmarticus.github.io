post_summary: "I published my dotfiles, which will be a good incentive for me to use them more enthusiastically, and it should also help me set up new dev machines in the future."

I was talking to my buddy [Cameron](https://cameron.otsuka.systems/) about all of the custom Claude code stuff I've been tinkering with (I talk about this in [Spinning Plates](/2025/11/07/spinning-plates.html) and [Racing towards Bethlehem](/2025/11/24/racing-towards-bethlehem.html)), and he asked me if he could see some of the agent stuff I've written. This made me realize that I've never actually published the dotfiles where I keep all my configurations. His question, plus recently reading [Justin's post about this](https://www.jmduke.com/posts/dotfiles.html), inspired me to clean up the code and [publish my dotfiles](https://github.com/dmarticus/dotfiles). Maybe folks will find them useful, but even if I'm the only one who does, I'm glad they're public.
