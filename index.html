<h1>Hi, I'm Dylan Martin. <br />Welcome to my website.</h1>
<h3>
  I'm a product-minded tech lead who builds things end-to-end: from user research to system design to shipping code. I care about solving the right problems, not just solving problems right. Outside work, I'm a ski bum, rock climber, amateur powerlifter, jazz pianist, and aspiring polyglot.
