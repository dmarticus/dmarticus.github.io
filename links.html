<h1>Recommendations</h1>

I consume a lot of content (what can I say, I'm a millenial in 2020) and I like sharing cool stuff I find with my friends.  
So, I figured I'd try and make a running list of links to things I've consumed and why I like them.  I'm going to try and update 
this weekly, we'll see how it goes.
