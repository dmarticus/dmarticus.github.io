<h1>Writing</h1>

<p>
This is still in a todo phase, largely because I haven't figured out a good way to do a blog on here yet.  I also haven't written anything worth reading
</p>

<ul class="posts">
{% for post in site.posts %}
<li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>I guess if you really care to read my effusive takes on life, you can check out this post about why I work where I work: <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/why-qualtrics-dylan-martin-software-engineer-seattle-wa/" target="_blank"> Why Qualtrics?</a>
