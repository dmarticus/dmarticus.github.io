<h1>Projects</h1>
Here are some of things I've worked on as a contributor...
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/scala-exercises/" target="_blank">Scala Exercises:</a> An Open Source project for learning different technologies based in the Scala Programming Language</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/higherkindness" target="_blank">Higherkindness:</a> Honest typed libraries and tools for anyone and everyone.  Within the higherkindness project I've mostly worked on Mu; specifically these projects:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-scala" target="_blank">mu-scala.</a> Mu RPC is a purely functional
            library for building RPC endpoint-based services with support for RPC and HTTP/2.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/higherkindness/sbt-mu-srcgen/" target="_blank">sbt-mu-srcgen.</a> An sbt plugin that
            brings the ability to generate mu-scala protocols, services, and clients into your Scala program as part of the
            build.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-scala-examples" target="_blank">mu-scala-examples.</a> Demo
            implementations for <a href="https://higherkindness.io/mu/" target="_blank">Mu,</a> a purely functional microservice
            library.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

and as the primary author...
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/scala-games" target="_blank">Scala games.</a>  Games implemented for the console using functional programming principles in Scala</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/dag4s" target="_blank">dag4s.</a> A library for rewriting and optimizing DAGs (directed-acyclic graphs) with FP Scala</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/functional-todo-app" target="_blank">Functional todo app.</a> An example project that implements a REST API and DB connection using (hopefully) best practice functional Scala.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/slackbot" target="_blank">Slackbot.</a>  Provides a simple way to implement an interactive Slackbot in Go without having to expose an HTTP server.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/sentiment-analyzer-cli" target="_blank">Sentiment analysis CLI.</a>  A CLI tool for analyzing the sentiment of a given phrase using a naive Bayes classifier with Laplace smoothing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/monkey" target="_blank">Monkey.</a>  This project implements a compiler for an example programming language (similar to JS) named Monkey.  It's my first foray into thinking about how compilers do things!</li>
</ul>

The rest of my stuff, none of which is particularly noteworthy, but serve as important milestones of my software development journey, can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/dmarticus/" targeting="_blank">Github</a>.
